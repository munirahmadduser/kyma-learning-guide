Welcome to MarkTwo ðŸŽ‰
MarkTwo lets you read and write markdown from a single, seamless view. When you enter a text block, it toggles to editing mode, and when you exit, it instantly renders to HTML. It continuously, efficiently, and securely syncs your content with your Google Drive, so you can close your laptop, and pick up where you left off on your phone.

MarkTwo stays snappy even for very large documents (tested on War & Peace), so you can use it for long-running efforts such as journals and running notes. You'll be able to navigate those big docs easily with quick, clear search results.

Plus it's free & open source!

Other HTML
The markdown spec is not intended to completely replace HTML, which you can fall back to if you want a particular tag or style. For example you can highlight text with the mark tag like this, or underline with the u tag like this.

The center tag is also handy!

Advanced text entry
Automatic text expansion for /now and /today. Use /date to bring up a date picker.
